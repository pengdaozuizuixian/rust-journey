# rust-journey

This project demonstrates a simple Rust program. The main function prints "Hello, world!" and then calls an `add` function to add two integers (2 and 3), printing the result as "Sum: 5".

## How it works
- The `main` function is the entry point.
- It prints a greeting message.
- It calls the `add` function with two integers and prints the sum.
- The `add` function takes two `i32` integers and returns their sum.
